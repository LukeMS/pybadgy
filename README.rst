Script to generate custom `shields.io`_-like badges, like those:

|custom_badge1|_ |custom_badge2|_

.. |custom_badge1| image:: https://lukems.github.io/pybadgy/badge1.svg
.. _custom_badge1: https://lukems.github.io/pybadgy/badge1.svg

.. |custom_badge2| image:: https://lukems.github.io/pybadgy/badge2.svg
.. _custom_badge2: https://lukems.github.io/pybadgy/badge2.svg

This is heavily based on coverage-badge (`copyright notice`_), including most of its code (with modifications).

.. _`copyright notice`: LICENSE-coverage-badge
.. _`shields.io`: https://shields.io/
